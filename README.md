# echo
## GNU Radio Compatible Codebase

This branch is primarily intended to support the `echo-gnuradio` repository, where it is included as a submodule.
It contains Python 2.7 compatible version of the modulators, demodulators, and utilities which were refactored into the much cleaner Python 3.x versions for release.
To the best of our knowledge, all behaviors relevant to the Echo protocol are preserved between the two versions of this code.

_This code will not be maintained_ as we have moved away from GNU Radio as the primary interface to USRP SDRs for our future work.
